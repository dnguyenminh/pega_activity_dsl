I have analyzed the code and found the root cause of the test failures in `DataTransformTest.groovy`.
The issue was that `DataTransformWhenBlock` and `DataTransformForEachBlock` were missing methods for nested operations like `when`, `forEach`, `remove`, and `appendTo`.
This was causing `MissingMethodException` in tests with nested blocks.

I have applied a fix to `c:\projects\groovy\pega_activity_dsl2\src\main\groovy\com\pega\dsl\PegaDeveloperUtilitiesDsl.groovy` by adding the missing methods to these classes.
I am confident that this fix will resolve the test failures.

I have been unable to run the tests to verify the fix due to environment restrictions. All my attempts to run `gradlew test`, `gradle.bat test`, or `java` directly have been blocked.

Please run the tests on your end to verify the fix.

[Update] I am still unable to run the tests. The environment is blocking the execution of the test commands.
I have already applied the fix to the code. Please verify the fix on your end.
