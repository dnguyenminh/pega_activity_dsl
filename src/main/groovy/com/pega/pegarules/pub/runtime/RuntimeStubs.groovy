/**
 * RuntimeStubs cleared.

 * This file previously declared many small stub classes that are now
 * defined in their own dedicated source files (e.g. Activity.groovy,
 * CollectionRule.groovy, ControlsInfo.groovy, etc.). Those duplicates
 * caused compilation errors. Keeping this file as an explicit placeholder
 * (no class definitions) to avoid reintroducing duplicates.
